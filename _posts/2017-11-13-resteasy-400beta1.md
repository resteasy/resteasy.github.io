Back at the end of July I mentioned that the team would have focussed on [JSR-370](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=370)... and here I am few months later, happy to announce that the _first Beta release of RESTEasy 4_ has been tagged over the weekend and it features [JAX-RS 2.1 implementation](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RESTEASY-1679).

However this beta comes with more additions... besides for the implementation of the latest specification for RESTful webservices in Java, here is a brief list of what&#39;s new:

*   [New async / NIO http client engine](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RESTEASY-1025) based on Apache HttpAsynchClient
*   [Extended server side async support and RxJava(2) integration](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RESTEASY-1701)
*   [Support for redirect in JAX-RS client](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RESTEASY-1075)
*   JDK 9 GA compatibility

The full release notes are [available on jira](https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=12335265&amp;styleName=Text&amp;projectId=12310560&amp;Create=Create), the artifacts are built and published on [Maven repositories](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/jboss/resteasy/resteasy-jaxrs-all/4.0.0.Beta1/) and the sources are on [GitHub](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy/tree/4.0.0.Beta1) as usual ;-)

Please consider trying the latest release and providing feedback!

Thanks
