Two new RESTEasy releases appeared recently, 4.3.0.Final and 3.9.0.Final. Both of them introduce a new feature which allows resource method parameters to be java.util.Optional&lt;T&gt; types, allowing a cleaner coding style. Like the previous 4.2.0.Final release, 4.3.0.Final includes performance improvement contributions from the community, and, of course, they both have bug fixes (upgrade early and often!) and component upgrades. 3.9.0.Final is the latest in the succession of releases targeted towards Wildfly, and it will ship with the upcoming Wildfly 18. 4.3.0.Final is targeted towards the next Quarkus release.
