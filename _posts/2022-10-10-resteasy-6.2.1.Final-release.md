Today [RESTEasy 6.2.1.Final]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads#621final) was released. This is a minor release mostly
consisting of component upgrades and some fixes for running RESTEasy with the security manager enabled. This was done
for the up and coming [WildFly 27.0.0.Final](https://www.wildfly.org/) release.

One point of interest might be a newly added Galleon feature pack. There is now a 
`org.jboss.resteasy:galleon-preview-feature-pack` which is based on WildFly Preview. This allows the latest RESTEasy
be used on either WildFly or WildFly Preview.

An example of installing RESTEasy in WildFly Preview 27.0.0.Beta1:
```shell
install org.wildfly:wildfly-preview-feature-pack:27.0.0.Beta1 --dir=wildfly-preview
install org.jboss.resteasy:galleon-preview-feature-pack:6.2.1.Final --dir=wildfly-preview
```
