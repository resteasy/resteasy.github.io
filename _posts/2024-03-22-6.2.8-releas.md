Today we'd like to announce the release of RESTEasy [6.2.8.Final]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads#628final). This release
contains some bug fixes as well as some notable changes in behavior.

## Client Changes

In [RESTEASY-3470](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3470) it was found that clients may leave connections
open longer than expected. The fix was to evict stale or closed connections after 60 seconds. Note this timeout is 
hard-coded.

In big news, we've [deprecated](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3473) the backing Apache HTTP Client. The
reason for doing this is we want to be able to replace this client with something newer that has HTTP/2 support. This
client, for at least the 6.2 stream, will continue to work and be the default. However, this may not be true in an
undetermined future release. We will however make an announcement before we change the default.

## EntityPart

In Jakarta REST 3.1 an `EntityPart` API was introduced. In the JavaDoc the 
[`EntityPart.getContent(Class)`](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/restful-ws/3.1/apidocs/jakarta.ws.rs/jakarta/ws/rs/core/entitypart#getContent(java.lang.Class)) and 
[`EntityPart.getContent(GenericType)`](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/restful-ws/3.1/apidocs/jakarta.ws.rs/jakarta/ws/rs/core/entitypart#getContent(jakarta.ws.rs.core.GenericType)) 
are only allowed to be invoked once. We've added the requirement of that 
restriction to RESTEasy. See [RESTEASY-3468](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3468) for details.

Previously when using an `EntityPart` as a `@FormParam` it was required to register the `jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application`
as a servlet with a `multipart-config`. This was not user-friendly and not well document. In [RESTEASY-363](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3463)
we solved this and now `@FormParam`'s can use the entity parts without the need to define a `multipart-config` on the
servlet.

## Exception Mapper

Previously in [RESTEASY-3380](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3380) a `JsonProcessingExceptionMapper` was
created to handle errors from Jackson when serializing/deserializing objects. We mistakenly returned a 500 error instead
of a 400. [RESTEASY-3443](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3443) corrects this by returning a 400 (Bad Request)
for these types of errors.


## Security

While we did not seem to be affected by [CVE-2024-2172](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2024-21742), we 
did upgrade [mime4j](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3467) as it was one easy to do and two will stop
security scanners from triggering issues.

## Testing

Not user facing but, it's worth noting a major change we have made to the RESTEasy testing for both the main branch
and the 6.2 branches. We've [migrated from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3388). This 
was a major task and the results have been great. Just note if, for any reason, you use utilities from the RESTEasy
test suite, they will now require JUnit 5.

## Finally

As always, [feedback](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy/discussions/) is welcome. Stay safe, and, depending on where 
you are, stay warm or be cool.
