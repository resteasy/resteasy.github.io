Two new releases, **4.5.8.Final** and **3.13.1.Final** are now available.

4.5.8.Final, besides bug fixes, upgrades, and performance improvements, adds a new method, ResteasyClientBuilder.disableAutomaticRetries(), which disables HTTP retries.

Note that we have skipped over 4.5.7.Final due to a glitch in the release process.

3.13.1.Final just has bug fixes and one upgrade.

Stay safe!
