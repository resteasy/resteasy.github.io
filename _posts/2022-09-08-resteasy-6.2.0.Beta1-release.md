Today [RESTEasy 6.2.0.Beta1]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads#final) was released. Except component 
upgrades, there are two changes which resulted in a 6.2.0.Beta1 instead of a 6.1.1.Final.

1. [RESTEASY-3085](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3085) - Upgrade Jackson to 2.13
2. [RESTEASY-3075](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3075) - Implement the `EntityPart.withName()`

Previously there was a [blocking bug](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-modules-base/issues/175) which did not allow 
RESTEasy to upgrade to Jackson 2.13. This bug as resolved, and we would like to upgrade Jackson in 
[WildFly](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-16228) too.

We discovered we did not attempt implement the `RuntimeDelegate.createEntityPartBuilder`. This is now implemented and
the `EntityPart.withName()` will work with RESTEasy 6.2.

You can read the full release notes on the [tag](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy/releases/tag/6.2.0.Beta1).

A 6.2.0.Final release is scheduled for 2022-09-22.
