I'm pleased to announce that RESTEasy 4.7.0.Final has been released.

## New Features

* A [Reactor-Netty server adaptor](https://docs.jboss.org/resteasy/docs/4.7.0.Final/userguide/html/RESTEasy_Embedded_Container.html#d4e2922) has been introduced to pair with the reactor-netty client.
* Better support for Java 16 and the up and coming Java 17 release. Due to these changes RESTEasy now requires Java 11 as it's minimum compile level. However, it still supports the Java 8 runtime.
* Support for [reactive publishers](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-2943) for the HTTP client have been introduced.

## Upcoming Changes

We are working on [upgrading WildFly](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-14812) to use RESTEasy 4.7.0.Final. The is hope to have this done for WildFly 25.

As projects move towards Jakarta EE 9.1 support, RESTEasy is doing the same. The 4.7.0.Final may be the last release of the 4.x series with Jakarta EE 9.1 support going into RESTEasy 5.

What can you expect? Hopefully the only changes that will be required is the same package name changes from `javax.*` to `jarkarta.*`. Our goal is to keep RESTEasy 5.0 the same and only change the package names.

## Documentation

As usual the documentation can be found on the [documentation site](https://docs.jboss.org/resteasy/docs/4.7.0.Final/userguide/html/index.html).
