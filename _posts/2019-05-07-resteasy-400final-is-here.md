At the end of March I was [announcing RESTEasy 4 CR1](https://developer.jboss.org/community/resteasy/blog/2019/03/28/resteasy-4-is-coming-soon) and telling the final was coming soon. Unfortunately it has taken more than I hoped for the transition; the nice thing, however, is that was because the community (especially [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) one) really tested the CRs and we got few bugs reported (and fixed ;-) ). In any case earlier today **the 4.0.0.Final artifacts have been built and released** to both Central and JBoss Nexus Maven repositories. The new [documentation](https://docs.jboss.org/resteasy/docs/4.0.0.Final/userguide/html/index.html), as well as the [binaries](https://resteasy.github.io/downloads.html), are available on the website.

[Previous blog posts](https://developer.jboss.org/community/resteasy/blog/2019/03/28/resteasy-4-is-coming-soon) already provided references to the new features coming with RESTEasy 4, I really encourage reading them.

Going beyond new features, I believe this release sets the ground for future exciting developments in RESTEasy; the project got rid of old / deprecated pieces and is in a better position for accomodating the implementation of new and modern features, especially for Quarkus cloud-related scenarios.

_Stay tuned and try RESTEasy 4... feedback is welcome!_
