Just in time before everybody goes and take some rest for 
Christmas... here we are with the long-awaited final release of our rest project ;-)



Seriously, **RESTEasy 3.1.0.Final** is out; we&#39;ve gone through ~20 additional bug fixes and misc tasks on top of the latest candidate release, but finally it&#39;s available on the [download page](https://resteasy.jboss.org/downloads), on the Maven repository and together with current [WildFly master](https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly).



Here is a brief 
high-level 
summary of what&#39;s coming in 3.1.0:


*   
major project cleanup

*   
most of the deprecated API moved to an optional _resteasy-legacy_ module

*   
performance improvements

*   
lots of dependencies upgrades

*   
new Vert.X adapter

*   
improved testsuite

*   
many bug fixes


A detailed list of the changes is available on [JIRA](https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20RESTEASY%20AND%20fixVersion%20in%20(3.1.0.Beta1%2C%203.1.0.Beta2%2C%203.1.0.CR1%2C%203.1.0.CR2%2C%203.1.0.CR3%2C%203.1.0.Final)%20ORDER%20BY%20fixVersion%20DESC%2C%20type%20DESC).

 


I really invite everybody to take a look at the [documentation](https://docs.jboss.org/resteasy/docs/3.1.0.Final/userguide/html_single/index.html), especially the sections concerning the migration from older versions, try the new release and let us know if anything needs changes.



Enjoy it and take some rest during Xmas time ;-)



Cheers
