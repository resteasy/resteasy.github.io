Version **3.15.0.Final** of RESTEasy is now available. The notable new feature is support for MicroProfile REST Client 2.0. Note that MP REST Client 2.0, besides new features like incorporation of SSE and greater CDI integration, now depends on Jakarta EE 8 APIs instead of Java EE 7. See the [release notes](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.microprofile/releases/rest-client-2.0) for more information.

There are also upgrades and bug fixes.

As always, feedback is welcome. Stay safe, and, depending on where you are, stay warm or be cool.
