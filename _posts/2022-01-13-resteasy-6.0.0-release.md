I'm pleased to announce the release of [RESTEasy 6]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads#600final). This is the first release of 
RESTEasy that is [Jakarta RESTful Web Services 3.0](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/restful-ws/3.0/) compliant. 
Overall this release is equivalent to RESTEasy 5.0 with changes for the `jakarta` namespace changes.

## Jakarta RESTful Web Services

RESTEasy 6 is a Jakarta RESTful Web Services 3.0 implementation. This version has been tested on WildFly and fully 
passes the Jakarta RESTful Web Services TCK.

RESTEasy 6.1 will be targeting Jakarta RESTful Web Services 3.1 which should be finalized very soon.

## Other Releases

With the release of RESTEasy 6, there have also been bug releases for [RESTEasy 5]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads#502final)
and [RESTEasy 4.7]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads#475final). See the [announcements](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy/discussions/categories/announcements) for more details.
