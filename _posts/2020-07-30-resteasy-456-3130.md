Users frequently scanning github for contributions and releases of **RESTEasy** might have noticed that during the past weeks we've tagged **4.5.6.Final** and **3.13.0.Final**.
Since yesterday, the website is also providing the corresponding downloads.

The main motivation for the new 4.5 micro version is fixing a nasty security issue (CVE-2020-14326) that could be exploited to cause a DoS; _we encourage eveybody running on RESTEasy 4.2 or greater to upgrade_.

RESTEasy 3.13.0.Final, instead, is a basically a bug fix release with the addition of a [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-2366](feature) related to client side integration with [https://wildfly-security.github.io/wildfly-elytron/](Elytron); this is a required step to have REST clients eventually rely on WildFly security (SSL, authentication, etc) configuration when running in-container.

Enjoy the summer, stay safe and see you soon here for next RESTEasy improvements!
