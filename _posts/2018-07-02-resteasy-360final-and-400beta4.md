You might have recently read about the very interesting new features being developed these days in **RESTEasy**... great, the time has come to _deliver them in a couple of releases!_

Last week, **RESTEasy 3.6.0.Final** and **4.0.0.Beta4** have been tagged, built and published; here is a list of the most relevant additions coming with them:

*   _client and server side reactive extensions_ [1][2]
*   _parameter annotations with default names_ [3][4]
*   _JettyClientEngine to use jetty-client with JAX-RS Client_ [5]
*   _SPI to modify resource metadata_ [6]

 

Moreover, 4.0.0.Beta4, also feature the first part of the changes for the _tracing system_ [7] and _asynchronous container filters_ [8] support.

Both releases are available on the usual Maven repository, feel free to try them out!

3.6.0.Final is also being pulled into WildFly master, targetting inclusion in **WildFly 14** release.

Enjoy!
